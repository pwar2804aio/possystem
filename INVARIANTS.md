# INVARIANTS.md — Hard Rules That Must Never Be Violated

If a proposed change would violate any rule here, **stop and ask** before proceeding.

---

## Schema Constraints

- Every table in the Ops DB has a `location_id` column. **All queries must filter by `location_id`.** Never write or read across locations.
- `menu_items.id` values starting with `m-` are locally-generated. They exist in Supabase but are not UUID format — don't assume UUID.
- `active_sessions` uses `(location_id, table_id)` as the unique key (upsert on conflict). One row per table per location.
- `locations.quick_screen_ids` is a jsonb array of item ID strings.
- `menu_categories.spacer_slots` is a jsonb array of `{id: string, sortOrder: number}` objects.
- `menu_categories.default_course` is an integer: 0=Immediate, 1=Course 1, 2=Course 2, 3=Course 3.

---

## Required Ordering / Sequencing

- **Boot sequence in SyncBridge.jsx:** config push snapshot → floor plan + menu + sessions (parallel Promise.all) → settings (quick screen, show images). Never reorder these or sessions will flash as empty.
- **Version bump sequence on every deploy:** (1) update `src/lib/version.js`, (2) add CHANGELOG entry at top of array in `src/App.jsx`, (3) `npm run build`, (4) `git push`.
- **Category field sync:** When adding a field to `menu_categories`, update ALL of: (a) `sbUpsertCategory` in `store/index.js`, (b) `upsertMenuCategory` in `lib/db.js`, (c) the `catsRes.data.map()` in `SyncBridge.jsx`.

## API Contract Shapes

### `addItem(item, mods, cfg, opts)` in store
- `item` — full menu item object from store
- `mods` — array of `{groupLabel, label, price, qty?}` 
- `opts` — `{notes, qty, linePrice, displayName}`
- Returns: new item appended to active table session or walk-in order

### Category object (in-store shape, camelCase)
```js
{ id, label, icon, color, menuId, parentId, sortOrder, accountingGroup, defaultCourse, spacerSlots, isSpecial }
```

### Session object
```js
{ items: [{uid, itemId, name, price, qty, mods, notes, allergens, course, fired, status, seat}], covers, seatedAt, sentAt, firedCourses }
```

### Config push snapshot (what Back Office sends to POS)
Must include: `menus`, `menuItems`, `menuCategories`, `tables`, `sections`, `quickScreenIds`, `profiles`, `modifierGroupDefs`, `instructionGroupDefs`, `taxRates`

## Security Boundaries

- **`VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` must never appear in git.** It's in Vercel env vars only. The local `.env.local` has a placeholder.
- **`loc-demo` must never be written to Supabase.** It's a mock sentinel. Every db write must verify `locationId !== 'loc-demo'` before proceeding.
- **POS devices authenticate via device pairing** (not user auth). Back office users authenticate via Supabase Auth. Don't mix these flows.
- **RLS policies:** The `locations` table has an UPDATE policy requiring `location_id IN (SELECT location_id FROM user_profiles WHERE id = auth.uid())`. Anonymous/device writes to `locations` will be rejected unless using the back office auth session.

---

## Looks Wrong But Intentional

- **`isMock = !SUPABASE_URL || !SUPABASE_ANON`** — This evaluates at build time from env vars. In local dev, `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=PASTE_YOUR_ANON_KEY_HERE` makes `isMock=true`. On Vercel, real keys make `isMock=false`. This is correct behaviour.
- **`_resolvedLocationId` module-level variable in `supabase.js`** — This is a module-singleton cache. Once resolved, `getLocationId()` returns the cached value synchronously (after the first async resolution). This is intentional for performance.
- **SessionReconciler skips `activeTableId`** — The table currently being edited by the operator is never overwritten by the reconciler, even if Supabase has a different version. This prevents clobbering work in progress.
- **Two separate session flush triggers** — `scheduleFlush()` debounces at 600ms. This is intentional to avoid hammering Supabase on rapid item additions.
- **`supabase.from(...).update(...).eq('id', item.id)` without `location_id` filter in `ItemImageUpload`** — This is intentional. Filtering by primary key `id` is sufficient and avoids the `getLocationId()` async lookup. The RLS policy still enforces location scoping.
- **`gridWithSpacers` merges spacers and items by `sortOrder`** — spacers have fractional/arbitrary sortOrder values to slot between items. When items are reordered, ALL sortOrders are reassigned as sequential integers via `reorderGrid()`.
